    <h1>Know Me Better!</h1>
    <p>I'm a 20-year-old who loves to code and travel. Programming has always been a passion of mine, and I enjoy spending hours tinkering with code, building websites and creating applications. When I'm not writing code, I'm often planning my next adventure. Traveling has allowed me to experience different cultures and expand my perspective, which has influenced the way I approach problem-solving and creativity.</p>
    <p>Coding and travel may seem like an odd combination, but for me, they go hand in hand. As I explore new places and encounter different ways of life, I'm inspired to create new things and bring fresh perspectives to my coding projects. Likewise, coding has helped me plan and organize my travels, from building my own travel apps to automating my itinerary planning.</p>
    <p>I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to combine my two passions. Recently, I had the opportunity to work remotely for a travel startup, where I developed their website and booking system. The experience allowed me to sharpen my coding skills while also contributing to a company that shares my love for travel.</p>
    <p>In the future, I hope to continue pursuing my passions in coding and travel. Whether it's building a travel-related app or working for a company that combines technology and travel, I'm excited to see where my skills will take me next.</p>
